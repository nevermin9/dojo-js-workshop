        Executing
    </h2>

    <p>
        The program needs to be <i>executed</i>, also referred to as <i>running the program.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        To make computer directly understand what to do, we use special utility either an
        <i>interpreter</i> or <i>compiler</i> to translate the code we wrote into commands a computer
        can understand
    </p>

    <p>
        It's typically asserted that JavaScript is <i>interpreted</i>,
        because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run.
        <strong>But that's not entirely correct!</strong>
        The JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly
        (also known as <i>JIT - Just In Time</i>)
        and then immediately runs the compiled code.
