    <p>
        JavaScript had been created for browsers.
        By the time it had been becoming better and better.
        Web Applications like Gmail, Google Maps showed that this language can
        give high performance and great user experience.
        Thankfully V8 engine and "Web 2.0", JavaScript is considered a serious language.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, with this in mind, the Node.js was created in 2009.
        It introduces a lot of innovative thinking and approaches for JavaScript <strong>server-side</strong> development
        that have already helped many developers.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Node.js</i> is a cross-platform and opensource Javascript runtime environment that allows the
        JavaScript to be run on the server-side.
        Node.js allows Javascript code to run outside the browser.
        Node.js comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development. 
    </p>

    <p>
        With Node.js we can do the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Manipulate files on the file system, shell scripts for file manipulation or network access
        </li>

        <li>
            Create interactive command-line interfaces
        </li>

        <li>
            Build web servers with HTTP
        </li>

        <li>
