            JavaScript
        </h1>

        <p>
            JavaScript is a programming language that was created in 1995 at Netscape
            as a scripting tool to manipulate web pages inside their browser, Netscape Navigator.
            Initially known as LiveScript, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript so they could position it as
            a companion for the Java language, a product of their partner, Sun Microsystems.
            Apart from some superficial syntactic similarities, though, JavaScript is in no way related to the Java programming language.

            In 1997, due to JavaScript's rapid growth, it became clear that the language would need
            to be properly maintained and managed. Therefore, Netscape handed the job of creating
            a language specification to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA),
            a body founded with the goal of standardizing computing. The ECMA specifications were labeled ECMA-262.
            Every new ECMAScript specification includes new features for JavaScript. Now, there are 12 editions of
            the ECMAScript specification.
