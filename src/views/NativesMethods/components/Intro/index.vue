        Intro
    </h2>

    <p>
        The data types and its values, we have covered, by themselves are not of a great value.
        Yes, you can store data of different types in variables, but programming is not only about
        data, also it is about <i>handling data</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To handle data, JavaScript uses built-in objects. It is more correct to say, built-in functions
        (which are subtype of <code>object</code> ) or <i>natives</i>.
        We have met one of them - <code>Object</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are natives too:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>
                    String()
                </code>
            </li>

            <li>
                <code>
                    Number()
                </code>
            </li>

            <li>
                <code>
                    Boolean()
                </code>
            </li>

            <li>
                <code>
                    Array()
                </code>
            </li>

            <li>
                <code>
                    Symbol()
                </code>
            </li>

            These are the major we will cover.
            But JavaScript contains also <code>Function()</code>, <code>Date()</code>, <code>Error()</code>, <code>RegExp()</code> and more.
            You can learn about them when you will need them during your work.
        </ul>
    </p>
